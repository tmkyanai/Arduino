# 03: IR remote LED
**Goal:** Control LED with remote actions.

**Wiring:** [Veiw the wiring In tinkercad] (https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jOHnmW8xkGy/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard)

**What I learned:**
- how resist work
- how to put wires just by my self
- how print and printIn works (print is where you can lable and print in makes a new line after that).
- what setup is (its just a one time play thing).
