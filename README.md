# 01 Blink
**Goal:** Make the LED on the Arduino UNO blink every half second.
**Wiring:** None (uses built-in LED on pin 13).
**What I learned:**
- `setup()` runs once at the beginning.
- `loop()` repeats forever.
- `digitalWrite` turns the LED on/off.
- `delay(500)` waits half a second.
# Arduino Learning
This repo tracks my Arduino beginner projects with UNO R3.
## Projects
- `projects/01_blink`: First LED blink
- `projects/02_button_led`: Press a button to toggle LED
- `projects/03_ir_remote_led`: Control LED with an IR remote (stretch)
## How I work
- I save changes often with short commit messages.
- I explain what I learned in each project's README.
