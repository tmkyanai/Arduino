# 01: Blink
**Goal:** Make the built-in LED blink every 0.5s.
**Wiring:** None (uses built-in LED on pin 13).
**What I learned:**
- `setup()` runs once, `loop()` repeats.
- `pinMode` and `digitalWrite` control the LED.
- `delay(500)` waits 0.5s.

- When 'delay(500)' to be changed to 'delay(100)', it blinked faster.
